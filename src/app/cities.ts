We hadn't been on the Eye for a good few years and it was definitely noticeable how very much improved everything was about the admin. When we arrived there was a queue, but this went down very quickly mainly due to the efficiency of the staff and the use of tickets on mobiles. We were soon on the Eye and had a fantastic ride due to the absolutely cloudless blue sky day. We've never seen London look so splendid and this made the ride so much more enjoyable.",
